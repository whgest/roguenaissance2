    conditions:

  tips:
    - Summoning friendly monsters is the best way to even the odds. Summoning will cost additional MP for each active summon you have.
    - Forced movement spells that Push or Pull foes can keep enemies off your back for as long you have the MP to use them.
    - Haste and Slow effects change how far units can move each turn. Use these to maneuver around enemies. Rooted units can not move at all, but can attack normally.
    - All classes have some way to heal damage. Astromancers can regenerate health over time with Soothing Starlight, Pyromancers can Drain Life from other units, and Terramancers can summon a Spring Breeze to heal them.

    conditions:
      - condition_type: on_goal_tile

  tips:
  - Clustered enemies can be crushed with a spell featuring a wide area of effect.
  - Your strongest spell can only be cast with full MP, but devastates all enemy units.
  - Summoned monsters have skills too, but they usually need a turn or two to charge up enough MP to use them.
  - All classes have a defensively oriented summon. Pyromancers and Astromancers also have an offensive summon, and Terramancers a healing summon.

  victory_condition:
    conditions:
      - condition_type: unit_defeated
        condition_value: Belshazzar

  tips:
    - Belshazzar's minions can be pushed or pulled into lava for an instant kill, but Belshazzar himself will not be felled so easily (neither will you!).
    - Belshazzar's MP are used and regenerated just like yours... if you allow him to fully charge, he will unleash a devastating spell.
    - Forcing Belshazzar to drain life from his minions instead of attacking or summoning is one way to turn the fight against him.
