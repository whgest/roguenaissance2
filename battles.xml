        <tip>Summoning friendly monsters is the best way to even the odds. Summoning will cost more MP the more active summons you have.</tip>
        <tip>Forced movement spells that Push or Pull foes can keep enemies off your back for as long you have the MP to use them.</tip>
        <tip>Haste and Slow effects change how far units can move each turn. Use these to maneuver around enemies. Rooted units can not move at all, but can attack.</tip>
        <tip>All classes have some way to heal. Astromancers can regenerate health over time with Soothing Starlight, Pyromancers can Drain Life, and Terramancers can summon a Spring Breeze to heal them.</tip>

        <tip>Clustered enemies can be crushed with a spell featuring a wide area of effect.</tip>
        <tip>Your strongest spell can only be cast with full MP, but devastates all enemy units.</tip>
        <tip>Summoned monsters have skills too, but they usually need a turn or two to charge up enough MP to use them.</tip>
        <tip>All classes have a defensively oriented summon. Pyromancers and Astromancers also have an offensive summon, and Terramancers a healing summon.</tip>

        <tip>Belshazzar's minions can be pushed or pulled into lava for an instant kill, but Belshazzar himself will not be felled so easily.</tip>
        <tip>Belshazzar's MP are used and regenerated just like yours... if you let him fully charge, he will unleash a devastating spell.</tip>
        <tip>Forcing Belshazzar to drain life from his minions instead of attacking or summoning is one way to turn the fight against him.</tip>
